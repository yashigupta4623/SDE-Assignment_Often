SDE Assignment – Travel Itinerary Backend System

1. Database Design

- Used SQLAlchemy to create models for:
  - Itinerary: Full trip info
  - Day: Each day of the trip
  - Accommodation: Hotel details
  - Transfer: Travel between places
  - Activity: Things to do

- Each itinerary has multiple days
- Each day can have activities, transfers, and accommodations
- Relationships and cascading deletes are set up

2. API with FastAPI

- Built using FastAPI and Pydantic
- SQLite used for database
- Two main endpoints:
  - POST /itineraries/ → Add a new itinerary
  - GET /itineraries/{id} → View a specific itinerary

Example POST Request:
{
  "name": "Beach Trip",
  "region": "Phuket",
  "nights": 3,
  "days": [...]
}

Example GET Response:
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Beach Trip",
  ...
}

3. MCP Server

- GET /recommendations/{nights}
- Returns suggested itineraries for given number of nights

4. Sample Data

- Added example itineraries for Phuket and Krabi (2 to 8 nights)
- Includes hotel names, transfers, and local activities

5. Summary

- Clean and modular code
- Proper validations and error handling
- Recommender endpoint working
